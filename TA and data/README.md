## TA / data

Welcome to the TA/Data team,
I am user TechnicalANALyst or Tech for short.

We are responsible for conducting TA to find crucial Support and Resistance levels on the banks
that the FA team has deemed high risk. We will proceed to track these banks and the levels they
trade at to monitor their value as we conduct a strategy to take our positions.

I am open to listening to your individual strategies and how you conduct your research but for 
this introductary period i would like to lay some framework for any beginners we may have.
I would like for you to research and understand the following indicators:
Ichimoku, candlestick trading, bollinger bands, Moving averages, Exponential moving averages, 
Volume, RSI, MACD, and Chaikin Oscillator. I am always available to help if you have questions
so please feel free to reach out. 

In addition to tracking the bank FA picks we will also track the major indicies futures, 
the banking sector as a whole, and commodities (NG,CL,GLD,and SLV). This will get us a great 
outlook over the market as a whole and where our plays fit in. 

I would like all analysis by the team to be done individually at first. This will prevent bias 
from entering the analysis. Read the chart as you see it and provide your perspective. We will
then as a group review all perspectives and reach a final conclusion of what is happening in the 
market.

I would love your opinions on best strategies moving forward and how we can best conduct our research.
Please reach out if you have any questions on the discord in our section and i will be happy to help!

Best Regards,
Tech
